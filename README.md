This program computes the distance between 2 documents by performing the following steps:

• Read file

• Make word list [“the”,“year”,. . . ]

• Count frequencies [[“the”,4012],[“year”,55],. . . ] 

• Compute Angle Metric: The angle between the vectors D1 and D2 gives an indication of overlap between the 2 documents.
